# Wonder-Tools
This repo for my private use only. I don't mind if you want to fork it, just do it. I don't accept any pull-request because I use as private.

I will focus on my OS that I will use at current time so don't expect it will work well on another OS. Right now I use Windows 10.

Some command will not make sense because it use under my develop environment.

# Install
`npm install git+https://git@github.com/ethaizone/wonder-tools.git`
